# Moderation-BD

A moderation extra package for [Ballsdex v3](https://github.com/Ballsdex-Team/BallsDex-DiscordBot).

Provides slash commands for common moderation actions: kick, ban, unban, mute, unmute, warn, purge, slowmode, lock/unlock channels, and nickname management. Warnings are persisted in the database and visible in the admin panel. And blah blah blah.

The base for this extra package comes from [molteencreates/BallsDex-DiscordBot-Moderation-Package](https://github.com/molteencreates/BallsDex-DiscordBot-Moderation-Package), with some modifications to fit the Ballsdex v3 ecosystem. Therefore, the proper credits goes to [**molteencreates**](https://github.com/molteencreates) for the original package.

## Disclaimer

For this extra package to work, you must enable the following permissions for the bot:

- `Kick Members`
- `Ban Members`
- `Manage Roles`
- `Manage Channels`
- `Change Nickname`

If you leave these permissions disabled, then bye bye, get out of this repository. `>:(`
